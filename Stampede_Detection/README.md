## IDEATION
With the expanding population and several problems arising due to crowded situations, the necessity of crowd detection is also at a raise. It includes assessing the number of individuals in the group and in addition the appropriation of the crowd density in different regions of the group. Estimation of such crowd density can be done from the image of the crowded scene. This paper proposes real-time approaches to solving problems related to dense crowds. It uses static images captured from a crowded area and attempts to estimate the crowd density of the area by applying two different techniques. The proposed techniques for estimating crowd are via image processing and another one is using Convolutional Neural Network. In the image processing technique, erosion is used to count head regions from the images. Images considered here are grayscale images. In CNN approach, deep learning technique is used to estimate the crowd density. A network of Raspberry Pi is used in order to perform the crowd detection as well as circulating the crowd condition to responsible authorities. At that point, the authorities might be alarmed about the likelihood of a stampede and can find a way to keep away from it.

* Many people have discussed this topic but there haven't been many implementations to this idea and it would be a fun and interesting project to make.

* This could be used in many places especially populated countries like India during trade fairs, festivals, etc.

* The CNN algorithm has to be used to detect the object/stampede.

* The main objective of this project is to build a self-sufficient software, that can accurately predict whether or not a stampede is imminent, based on the incoming live visuals of a place.

* Most current stampede prevention solutions are reliant on hardware(footfall mats based on sensors etc), bringing along with it the question of capital investment, installation and maintenance costs and issues in the long run.

* The key innovation we hope to create here is steer this project in the direction of a completely software-based solution(based on Computer Vision Technology, that does not depend on inputs from any electronic hardware, which can be done using only the live CCTV visuals of the area we are monitoring) for this problem, that can provide good levels of accuracy to accurately predict stampedes, so that some kind of intervention can be done at the right time to prevent such incidents in the future.

I tried to make this project on my own last year but had unsufficient knowledge but now I think with a team and sufficient knowledge it is possible.
